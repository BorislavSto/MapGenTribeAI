# MapGenTribeAI
This is a project for university where I combined two systems into one.
I created a map generator that can create different plane meshes with varied noise and materials, and then combine them into one world mesh.
The other part is a "Tribe" AI, where AI agents belong to teams with origin points (their tribes), and they can have relationships with other tribes that are positive, neutral, or negative.
